# powerBI-Retail_Analysis
Created a custom report in powerBI using the retail analysis sample dataset containing retail sales data of items sold across multiple stores and districts in the United States. 
Used several visualisations like 
- stacked bar and line chart to visualise and analyse the difference between total units sold by category over the span of 2 years.
- Treemap for visualising and analysing the total units sold during a particular year by Buyer category. Also used the advanced filtering option to analyse the same for south-eastern part.
- Map and filled map to visualise territorial data for locating stores in the eastern US
- Used gauge and cylindrical gauge visualisations along with clustered column chart and slicers to compare a particular year's sales against it's set target for different regions.
Also created a dashboard with an alert rule for notifying users in case of the yearly sales crossing a particular threshold.
